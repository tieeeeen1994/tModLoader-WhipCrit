# Summary

This mod adds the ability for whips to critically hit using default computation of Terraria.

# TODO

1. Whip tooltips do not contain critical chance.
2. Whips do not have a default of 4% crit. I had to use a Lucky accessory to get it to critically hit.

# Changelog

v0.1
- Initial release.
