# Summary

This mod adds unique armor modifiers. They're not a lot, but they are super expensive to reforge. Reforging armor has different rules than what weapons or accessories have.

1. Armor will never get a modifier in any way except by reforging with the Goblin Tinkerer.
2. The base cost for reforging armor is 10 times its own value.
3. All armor modifiers are unique. They all have 4 tiers, 2 of them being negative and the other 2 positive. They are as listed below.

- Attack Speed %
- Flat Health
- Minion Slot
- Critical Damage
- Flat Health Regeneration
- Whip Range %

Reforge cost multiplier is configurable.

The stats adjustment for each prefix are now also configurable.
